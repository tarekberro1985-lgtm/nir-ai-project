# AI-Assisted NIR Quality Analysis

Building AI course project

## Summary
This project explores the use of artificial intelligence to support and improve quality analysis using Near-Infrared (NIR) spectroscopy. By learning from historical NIR measurements, the system aims to assist laboratory staff with more consistent and reliable interpretation of results.  
*Building AI course project*

## Background
NIR analysis is widely used in quality control, but results can be influenced by measurement conditions, sample handling, and user experience. This project addresses the need for decision support that helps reduce variability and human error in routine NIR analyses.

## How is it used?
The solution is intended for laboratory technicians and quality engineers who perform NIR measurements. The AI system provides decision support by highlighting patterns, deviations, or inconsistencies in NIR data to support better judgment, not to replace human expertise.

## Data sources and AI methods
The project is based on historical NIR spectra and reference quality data collected during routine laboratory analyses. Machine learning techniques are used to identify patterns and correlations between NIR signals and quality parameters.

## Challenges
This project does not eliminate the need for proper calibration, validated reference methods, or skilled laboratory personnel. Data quality, instrument variability, and ethical responsibility remain important limitations.

## What next?
Future development could include building a prototype model, integrating the solution with laboratory information systems, and expanding the system to support real-time monitoring and predictive quality control.
